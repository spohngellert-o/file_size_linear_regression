# file_size_linear_regression

## What:
##### Generating random text files of size 0-999 bytes, and their compressions. Then creating a linear regression of text file size to compression size.
## Findings:
##### Generally, the size of the compression is extremely predictable, at about 0.6 times the size of the original file.
